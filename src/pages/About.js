          Hi, I'm Kunal. I've spent my entire 15+ years career rooted firmly in
          design. My path has taken me from graphic design to interactive design
          to interaction design to product design to product engineering to
          product management. Yeesh!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="flex">
        <div className="lg:w-1/3">
          <h3>Hello</h3>
        </div>
        <div className="lg:w-2/3">
          <p>
            Because of my varied journey cycling between design, product, and
            engineering, I find it more useful to describe the activities and
            functions that come very naturally to me:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Building React.js prototypes to make </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
    </>
  );
}
